## 📚 About This Repository

This repo documents my journey learning C++ from beginner to advanced over 4 months. I'm following a structured curriculum covering:

- ✅ Foundations (syntax, variables, control flow, functions)
- ⏳ Core C++ (pointers, OOP, memory management)
- ⏳ Modern C++ (STL, smart pointers, lambdas)
- ⏳ Advanced (templates, concurrency, move semantics)
- ⏳ Professional (design patterns, build systems, interview prep)
